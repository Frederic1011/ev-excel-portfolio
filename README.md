## 1. Global EV Market Growth (2010–2023)
![Global EV Market Trend](01_global_market_trend.png)

**Insight:**  
Global EV sales increased from ~0.03M vehicles in 2010 to ~34.6M in 2023, representing a ~74% CAGR.  
Growth accelerated significantly after 2020, indicating a structural shift rather than cyclical adoption.

**Why it matters:**  
Establishes EVs as a high-growth market with clear inflection points, useful for demand forecasting and capacity planning.

**Insight:**  
China is the primary driver of global EV sales growth between 2010 and 2023, contributing substantially more incremental volume than Europe and North America combined.

**Why it matters:**  
Highlights geographic concentration risk and the importance of regional market dynamics when evaluating global performance.

**Insight:**  
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) account for the majority of incremental EV sales growth, indicating a clear shift away from hybrid powertrains over time.

**Why it matters:**  
Provides evidence for technology-driven adoption trends and supports BEV-focused investment and infrastructure decisions.
